# Internship Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis

## Description
This repository contains my SQL work for **Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis**. The objective of this task was to practice extracting and analyzing data from a database using SQL queries.  

I used the **ecommerce dataset** to write queries that demonstrate filtering, sorting, aggregation, subqueries, and basic analysis.

## Contents of the Repository
1. **CSV File** – `ecommerce.csv` (the dataset used for analysis)  
2. **SQL File** – `queries.sql` (all SQL queries written for the task)  
3. **Screenshots** – Folder containing screenshots of query outputs to show results.

## SQL Queries Included
- **Query 1:** Preview first 10 rows of the table  
- **Query 2:** Female customers only  
- **Query 3:** Female customers aged 25-45  
- **Query 4:** Transactions sorted by NetAmount descending  
- **Query 5:** Total NetAmount by ProductCategory  
- **Query 6:** Average NetAmount by AgeGroup  
- **Query 7:** Count of transactions with discount  
- **Query 8:** Customers spending above average  
- **Query 9:** Total NetAmount per Location  
- **Query 10:** Top 5 customers by total NetAmount  
- **Query 11:** Sales of products where discount was applied  
- **Query 12:** Monthly sales trend  

Each query is saved in the SQL file and screenshots of the outputs are included for reference.

## How to Use
1. Open the `ecommerce.csv` file in any SQL tool or database (like DB Browser for SQLite, MySQL Workbench, or VS Code with SQLTools).  
2. Execute the queries in `queries.sql` to see the results.  
3. Refer to the screenshots to verify the outputs.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (Sample dataset for e-commerce transactions).

This repository demonstrates how to use **SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT), and subqueries** to analyze data effectively in SQL.
